# üß† Brain Stroke Prediction

This repository contains a university project aimed at predicting brain stroke occurrences using machine learning techniques. The project has two main objectives:

1. **Paper Replication**: Reproduce the methodologies and findings of the research paper *"Stroke Risk Prediction with Machine Learning Techniques"*.
2. **Best Practices Implementation**: Develop an alternative version employing contemporary best practices in machine learning and data analysis.

- `report/`: Contains the comprehensive project report detailing methodologies, experiments, and results.
- `images/`: Directory for visualizations and plots used in the notebooks and report.
- `resources/`: Additional resources and references utilized in the project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue in Paper Replication

**Important**: In the `NAML_project_paper_replica_A.ipynb` notebook, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to both the training and test datasets.  
This is a **methodological error** that leads to **data leakage** and overly optimistic model performance.  
To see a corrected version using best practices, refer to the `NAML_project_best_practice_B.ipynb` notebook, where SMOTE is correctly applied **only to the training set**.
